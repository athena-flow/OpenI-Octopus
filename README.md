## Introduction

OPENI is a cluster management tool and resource scheduling platform, initially designed and jointly developed by [Microsoft Research (MSR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/), [Microsoft Search Technology Center (STC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ard/company/introduction.aspx), [Peking University](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/EN/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](http://www.cesc.zju.edu.cn/index_e.htm), and [University of Science and Technology of China](http://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/), and [maintained by PCL LAB](http://www.pcl.ac.cn/), [Peking University](http://idm.pku.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China
](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/)and [AITISA](http://www.aitisa.org.cn/).
The platform incorporates some mature design that has a proven track record in large scale Microsoft production environment, and is tailored primarily for academic and research purpose. 

OPENI supports AI jobs (e.g., deep learning jobs) running in a GPU cluster. The platform provides a set of interfaces to support major deep learning frameworks: CNTK, TensorFlow, etc. The interface provides great extensibility: new deep learning framework (or other type of workload) can be supported by the interface with a few extra lines of script and/or Python code.

OPENI supports GPU scheduling, a key requirement of deep learning job. 
For better performance, OPENI supports fine-grained topology-aware job placement that can request for the GPU with a specific location (e.g., under the same PCI-E switch).

OPENI embraces a [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) architecture: every component runs in a container.
The system leverages [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to deploy and manage system service.
The latest version of OPENI,the scheduling engine of more dynamic deep learning jobs also uses Kubernetes,
which enables system services and deep learning jobs to be scheduled and managed using Kubernetes. 
The storage of training data and results can be customized according to platform/equipment requirements.
Jobs logs are collected by [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/cn/products/beats/filebeat) and stored in [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/cn/products/elasticsearch) cluster.

## An Open AI Platform for R&D and Education 

OPENI is completely open: it is under the Open-Intelligence license. OPENI is architected in a modular way: different module can be plugged in as appropriate. This makes OPENI particularly attractive to evaluate various research ideas, which include but not limited to the following components: 

* Scheduling mechanism for deep learning workload
* Deep neural network application that requires evaluation under realistic platform environment
* New deep learning framework
* Compiler technique for AI
* High performance networking for AI
* Profiling tool, including network, platform, and AI job profiling
* AI Benchmark suite
* New hardware for AI, including FPGA, ASIC, Neural Processor
* AI Storage support
* AI platform management 

OPENI operates in an open model: contributions from academia and industry are all highly welcome. 

## System Deployment

### Prerequisite

The system runs in a cluster of machines each equipped with one or multiple GPUs. 
Each machine in the cluster runs Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and has a statically assigned IP address.
To deploy services, the system further relies on a Docker registry service (e.g., [Docker hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/)) 
to store the Docker images for the services to be deployed.
The system also requires a dev machine that runs in the same environment that has full access to the cluster.
And the system need [NTP](http://www.ntp.org/) service for clock synchronization.

### Deployment process
To deploy and use the system, the process consists of the following steps.

1. [Deploy Kubernetes 1.13 for OPENI-octopus system](https://www.processon.com/view/link/5d157ebae4b0a916e8f6bcc5)
2. [Deploy OPENI-octopus system services](./install_openi_octopus.md)
3. Access [web portal](https://github.com/open-intelligence/OpenI-Octopus/tree/k8s/web-portal) for job submission and cluster management

#### Job management

After system services have been deployed, user can access the web portal, a Web UI, for cluster management and job management.
Please refer to this [tutorial](./user%20manual.pdf) for details about job submission.

#### Cluster management

The web portal also provides Web UI for cluster management.

## System Architecture

</p>

The system architecture is illustrated above. 
User submits jobs or monitors cluster status through the Web Portal, 
which calls APIs provided by the [REST server](https://github.com/open-intelligence/OpenI-Octopus/tree/k8s/rest-server).
Third party tools can also call REST server directly for job management.
Upon receiving API calls, the REST server coordinates with k8s ApiServer, k8s Scheduler will schedule the job to k8s node with CPU,GPU and other resources.
[FrameworkController](https://github.com/open-intelligence/OpenI-Octopus/tree/k8s/frameworkcontroller) will monitor the job life cycle in k8s cluster.
Restserver retrieve the status of jobs from k8s ApiServer, and its status can display on Web portal.
Other type of CPU based AI workloads or traditional big data job
can also run in the platform, coexisted with those GPU-based jobs. 
The storage of training data and results can be customized according to platform/equipment requirements.
